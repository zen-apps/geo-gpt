# PyPI Preparation Checklist

This repository has been updated to be ready for PyPI publishing. Here's a summary of changes made and a final checklist.

## Changes Made

1. ✅ **Updated `.gitignore`** - Comprehensive patterns for Python packages
2. ✅ **Fixed `setup.py`** - Corrected metadata and content type for README
3. ✅ **Created `pyproject.toml`** - Modern Python packaging support
4. ✅ **Updated `MANIFEST.in`** - Includes all necessary files and excludes unwanted ones
5. ✅ **Enhanced `Makefile`** - Added publishing commands
6. ✅ **Created publishing guide** - Detailed steps in `publish.md`
7. ✅ **Removed redundant file** - Moved `geo_gpt.py` to backup
8. ✅ **Removed Jupyter notebook directory** - Cleaned up repository

## Final Checklist Before Publishing

1. **Review Package Content**
   - [ ] Verify all necessary code files are included
   - [ ] Ensure package data files (CSV) are properly included
   - [ ] Check for any remaining debug code or comments

2. **Update Metadata**
   - [ ] Verify author information in `setup.py` and `pyproject.toml`
   - [ ] Confirm GitHub repository URL is correct
   - [ ] Check version number is appropriate (0.1.0 for initial release)

3. **Documentation**
   - [ ] README provides clear installation and usage instructions
   - [ ] Environment variable requirements are clearly documented
   - [ ] Example code is up-to-date

4. **Dependencies**
   - [ ] All required dependencies are listed in `setup.py`
   - [ ] Version requirements are appropriate

5. **Clean Repository**
   - [ ] No unnecessary files (like jupyter_notebook/) included
   - [ ] No large data files committed
   - [ ] No sensitive information (API keys, etc.)

## Publishing Steps

1. **Local Build and Test**
   ```bash
   # Clean any previous builds
   python -m pip install --upgrade build wheel setuptools twine
   rm -rf build/ dist/ *.egg-info/
   python -m build
   ```

2. **Test PyPI Upload**
   ```bash
   twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
   ```

3. **Final PyPI Upload**
   ```bash
   twine upload dist/*
   ```

4. **Tag Release**
   ```bash
   git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Release v0.1.0"
   git push origin v0.1.0
   ```

With these changes, the geo-gpt repository is now clean, well-structured, and ready for publishing to PyPI! The setup follows modern Python packaging best practices and provides clear documentation for users.
